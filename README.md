# PythonTetromino
## *Tetris Ã  la Python*

Most of the `tetromino.py` code is from Al Sweigart's amazing book [Making Games with Python & Pygame](https://inventwithpython.com/pygame/); I adjusted the `main()` function to enable it to not play music if things aren't set up properly on your computer.

### Requirements

Create a virtual environment with Python3 installed and make sure you install the following into the venv:

```
alsa-lib-devel
gcc
gcc-c++
make
pygame
simpleaudio
```
